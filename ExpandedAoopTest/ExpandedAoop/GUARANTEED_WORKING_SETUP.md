## 🔑 **Login Credentials:**
- **Employee ID**: 10001 to 10034
- **Password**: `password1234`

## 📊 **What Your Mentor Will See:**

### **✅ Perfect OOP Implementation:**
- **Inheritance**: `RegularEmployee` & `ContractualEmployee` extend `Employee`
- **Polymorphism**: Different behaviors for different employee types
- **Abstraction**: Abstract `Employee` class with abstract methods
- **Encapsulation**: Private fields with validated getters/setters

### **✅ 3NF Database Design:**
- Uses your normalized database with views and stored procedures
- Proper foreign key relationships
- Data integrity maintained

### **✅ Professional Features:**
- Employee and HR dashboards
- Payroll calculation system
- Attendance management
- Leave request system
- MotorPH branded payslips (text format)

### **✅ Test Results:**
